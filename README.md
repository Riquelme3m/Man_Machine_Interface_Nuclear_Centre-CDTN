# Scientific Initiation Project: Study of Thermal Fatigue Behavior in Steel Pipes

## Introduction
Steel pipes subjected to temperature variations experience thermal stresses that can lead to material failure due to both thermal and mechanical fatigue. This project aims to investigate the behavior of AISI 316L and A 108 steels, as well as dissimilar welded joints using inconel 82 and inconel 182 alloys, under simultaneous thermal cycling and tensile loading.

## Objectives
- Instrument and monitor a thermal fatigue testing machine to study the behavior of test specimens.
- Develop a Man Machine Interface to simulate and monitor crack growth resulting from simultaneous thermal and mechanical loading.
- Train the research group in the study and analysis of thermal fatigue phenomena.



## Methodology
### Materials and Methods
- Conduct a three-month literature review to gather relevant information.
- Perform error analyses and calibrations to ensure measurement reliability.
- Plan and develop automation and control software using appropriate tools like LabVIEW.
- Instrument the thermal fatigue testing machine with temperature, airflow, electrical current, and mechanical force sensors.
- Establish connection between the developed software and the testing machine to control thermal fatigue tests.

### Experimental Procedures
- Conduct tests to verify the functionality of the developed software.
- Analyze test results and prepare reports for publication.

## Expected Outcomes
This project will provide insights into the thermal fatigue behavior of steel pipes, contributing to the understanding of material degradation mechanisms under cyclic thermal and mechanical loading.
